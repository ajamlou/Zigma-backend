# Zigma
Backend code for the mobile app Zigma. The application aims to centralize the academic second hand book market. The application has a backend written in Django/Django channels together with Microsoft Azure. The application was part of my bachelor's dissertation, together with three other students. My head responsibility was UX design and backend development, where I focused on modelling the database and creating the API.
